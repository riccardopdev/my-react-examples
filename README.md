# My React Examples

Welcome to my repository for React examples and snippets! This repository serves as a collection of various React projects, components, and code snippets that I've developed for learning and reference purposes.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a variety of React examples covering different concepts, techniques, and use cases. These examples are intended to showcase my understanding of React and provide practical demonstrations of React's capabilities.

## Getting Started

To explore any of the examples in this repository, simply navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the **README.md** file within that directory.

## List of content

- **async-data-loading**: This folder contains a series of projects that showcase asynchronous data loading and the management of loading progress, error messages, and data display.
  - **axios-typescript**: This project uses the `axios` library and TypeScript to load data and manage loading progress and error messages.
  - **fetch-redux**: This project uses the `fetch` API to load data, and the `Redux` library to manage the state for tracking loading progress, errors, and data.
  - **fetch-typescript**: This project uses the JavaScript `fetch` API and TypeScript to load data and manage loading progress and error messages.
- **context**: This project demonstrates the implementation of React's context using TypeScript.
- **context-reducer**: This project demonstrate the implementation and integration of React's context and reducer using TypeScript.
- **website-template**: The objective of this project is to demonstrate one of many typical setup for a React website using react-router-dom to manage routes, and a combination of React's reducer and context API to manage the state. The website uses the JSONPlaceholder API to handle data requests. Styling is implemented using CSS modules for each component, as well as a global CSS reset, common styles, and CSS variables.
